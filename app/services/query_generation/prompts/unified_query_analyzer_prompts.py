# Unified analyzer prompt (same as before)
UNIFIED_ANALYZER_PROMPT = """
You are an expert database query analysis system. Your job is to understand what the user wants and provide a complete analysis for execution.

## User Request Analysis

**User Query**: {query}
**Available Directives**: {directives}
**Database Type**: {database_type}

## Your Analysis Tasks

Analyze the user's request and provide a structured response covering these areas:

### 1. INTENT CLASSIFICATION
Determine the primary intent:

**query_generation**: User wants to generate a database query to retrieve, filter, calculate, or analyze data
- Examples: "Show me EURUSD prices", "Calculate correlation between currencies", "Top 10 trades today"
- Indicators: Specific data requests, calculations, filtering, aggregations

**schema_description**: User wants to understand the database structure, available tables, columns, or data organization
- Examples: "What tables do you have?", "Show me the schema structure", "What market data is available?"
- Indicators: Questions about tables, columns, schema, data availability, structure

**help**: User needs assistance with using the system, syntax, or general guidance
- Examples: "How do I query data?", "Help me with KDB syntax", "What can I do with this system?"
- Indicators: Requests for help, guidance, instructions, tutorials

### 2. CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT
Rate your confidence in the intent classification:
- **high**: Very clear what the user wants (>90% confident)
- **medium**: Reasonably clear but some ambiguity (70-90% confident) 
- **low**: Ambiguous or unclear request (<70% confident)

### 3. ENTITY EXTRACTION
Identify specific entities mentioned:
- **Symbols/Instruments**: Currency pairs (EURUSD, GBPUSD), stocks (AAPL, MSFT), etc.
- **Time References**: today, yesterday, last 7 days, 30-minute intervals, specific dates
- **Numerical Values**: Thresholds (0.7), quantities (top 5), percentages
- **Data Fields**: price, volume, bid, ask, correlation, volatility
- **Operations**: calculate, show, filter, compare, aggregate
- **Table References**: Specific table names mentioned

### 4. QUERY COMPLEXITY (Only for query_generation intent)
Determine if this needs single-line or multi-line approach:

**SINGLE_LINE** - Simple operations that can be done in one KDB+/q expression:
- Basic data retrieval with simple filters
- Simple aggregations (avg, sum, count, max, min)
- Top N queries with sorting
- Direct column selections
- Examples: "Show EURUSD today", "Average price of AAPL", "Top 5 largest trades"

**MULTI_LINE** - Complex operations requiring intermediate steps:
- Multiple transformation stages
- Complex calculations (correlation, rolling windows, statistical analysis)
- Time bucketing followed by aggregations
- Conditional logic based on calculated values
- Multiple data processing steps
- Examples: "Calculate correlation then filter results", "Bucket by time intervals then analyze", "Complex multi-step transformations"

### 5. EXECUTION PLAN (Only for query_generation intent)
Break down the logical steps needed:
- For SINGLE_LINE: Brief description of the single operation
- For MULTI_LINE: Numbered sequence of logical steps

### 6. QUERY TYPE (Only for query_generation intent)
Categorize the type of database operation:
- **select_basic**: Simple data retrieval
- **select_filter**: Data retrieval with filtering
- **aggregate**: Aggregation operations (sum, avg, count)
- **correlation**: Correlation analysis
- **time_series**: Time-based analysis
- **ranking**: Top N, sorting operations
- **statistical**: Statistical calculations
- **join**: Multiple table operations
- **complex_analysis**: Multi-step analytical operations

## Output Format

Provide your analysis in this exact format:

```
Intent_Type: [query_generation | schema_description | help]
Confidence: [high | medium | low]
Entities: [comma-separated list of specific entities found]
