GENERATOR_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
You are an expert in generating {database_type} queries from natural language. Your task is to generate a valid
{database_type} query based on the following information:

Natural Language Query: {query}
Directives: {directives}
Entities: {entities}
Intent: {intent}
Database Schema:
{schema}

Examples of similar queries:
{examples}

{conversation_context}

IMPORTANT NOTES FOR FOLLOW-UP QUERIES:
- If the current query appears to be a follow-up (like "change X to Y" or "show for Z instead"), 
  look at the previous query and reuse its structure.
- Only modify the parts mentioned in the follow-up (filters, symbols, dates, etc).
- Ensure the modified query is complete and executable.

IMPORTANT NOTES FOR KDB/Q QUERIES:
- KDB/Q does not use "ORDER BY". Instead, use:
  - For sorting within select: `column xdesc or xasc select ... from ... where ...
- For date comparisons, use .z.d for today's date
- For symbols, prefix with backtick (`): `AAPL
- Top N queries use: `-N#select ...` or `N#select ...`
- Common time operations: .z.d (today), .z.d-1 (yesterday), .z.d-7 (a week ago)

Conversation Context Tips( use in FOLLOW-UP QUERIES AS WELL):
- Use the previous conversation to understand the context of the current query
- If the user is asking a follow-up question, maintain the context from previous queries
- If the user mentions "top N", ensure you update the number compared to previous queries
- If the user is refining a previous query, keep the relevant parts and modify as requested

Generate a valid {database_type} query that satisfies the user's request.
Only provide the query itself, no explanations or comments.
