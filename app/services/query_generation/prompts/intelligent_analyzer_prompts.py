SCHEMA_AWARE_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """
You are an expert database query analysis system with full schema context. Your job is to analyze user requests and determine the optimal approach for query generation.

## Input Context

**User Query**: {query}
**Database Type**: {database_type}
**Available Directives**: {directives}
**Available Schema**: {schema_summary}
**Conversation Context**: {conversation_context}

## Analysis Tasks

Analyze the user's request with full schema knowledge and provide a comprehensive analysis:

### 1. ENTITY EXTRACTION
Identify specific entities mentioned or implied:
- **Symbols/Instruments**: Currency pairs (EURUSD, GBPUSD), stocks (AAPL, MSFT), etc.
- **Time References**: today, yesterday, last 7 days, 30-minute intervals, specific dates
- **Numerical Values**: Thresholds (0.7), quantities (top 5), percentages
- **Data Fields**: price, volume, bid, ask, correlation, volatility
- **Operations**: calculate, show, filter, compare, aggregate
- **Table References**: Specific table names mentioned or implied

### 2. SCHEMA-INFORMED COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS
Determine query complexity based on schema constraints and user requirements:

**SINGLE_LINE** - Simple operations achievable in one KDB+/q expression:
- Basic data retrieval with simple filters
- Simple aggregations (avg, sum, count, max, min) on single table
- Top N queries with sorting
- Direct column selections from available schema
- Operations that map directly to available table structure

**MULTI_LINE** - Complex operations requiring intermediate steps:
- Multiple transformation stages
- Complex calculations (correlation, rolling windows, statistical analysis)
- Time bucketing followed by aggregations
- Operations involving multiple tables or complex joins
- Conditional logic based on calculated values
- Schema limitations that require step-by-step approach

**COMPLEX_ANALYSIS** - Advanced analytical operations:
- Multi-step statistical analysis
- Complex time series operations
- Advanced mathematical computations
- Multiple schema integration

### 3. SCHEMA CONSTRAINT ANALYSIS
Analyze how the available schema affects the approach:
- **Available Tables**: What tables can fulfill this request?
- **Column Availability**: Are requested columns available?
- **Join Requirements**: Does this need multiple tables?
- **Data Type Constraints**: Do data types support requested operations?
- **Schema Limitations**: What might force complexity escalation?

### 4. EXECUTION PLAN CREATION
Create a logical execution plan based on schema and complexity:
- For SINGLE_LINE: Brief description of the unified operation
- For MULTI_LINE: Step-by-step breakdown of intermediate operations
- For COMPLEX_ANALYSIS: Detailed analytical workflow

### 5. QUERY TYPE CLASSIFICATION
Determine the specific type of database operation:
- **select_basic**: Simple data retrieval
- **select_filter**: Data retrieval with filtering
- **aggregate**: Aggregation operations (sum, avg, count)
- **correlation**: Correlation analysis
- **time_series**: Time-based analysis with bucketing
- **ranking**: Top N, sorting operations
- **statistical**: Statistical calculations
- **join**: Multiple table operations
- **complex_analysis**: Multi-step analytical operations

### 6. CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT
Rate your confidence in the analysis:
- **high**: Schema clearly supports request, approach is straightforward
- **medium**: Some schema limitations but workable approach exists
- **low**: Schema constraints may limit fulfillment of request

## Output Format

Provide your analysis in this exact format:

```
ENTITIES: [comma-separated list of specific entities found]
COMPLEXITY: [SINGLE_LINE | MULTI_LINE | COMPLEX_ANALYSIS]
EXECUTION_PLAN: [step 1, step 2, step 3... for multi-line | single operation description for single-line]
QUERY_TYPE: [select_basic | select_filter | aggregate | correlation | time_series | ranking | statistical | join | complex_analysis]
CONFIDENCE: [high | medium | low]
SCHEMA_CONSTRAINTS: [any limitations or considerations from available schema]
REASONING: [detailed explanation of your analysis decisions, including schema considerations]
```

## Schema-Driven Decision Rules

Apply these considerations when analyzing:

1. **Automatic MULTI_LINE triggers**:
   - Query needs 3+ tables from schema
   - Time bucketing + aggregation on available time columns
   - Statistical functions not available as single operations
   - Schema structure requires intermediate transformations

2. **Schema limitation handling**:
   - Missing columns → suggest alternatives or mark as constraint
   - Complex relationships → plan for step-by-step joins
   - Data type mismatches → plan for conversions

3. **Available schema optimization**:
   - Use most appropriate tables from available schema
   - Leverage existing column structures
   - Consider pre-computed aggregations if available

Now analyze the user request with full schema context.
"""

RETRY_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """
You are analyzing a retry request with full context from previous attempts and user feedback.

## Context
**Original User Request**: {original_query}
**Previously Generated Query**: {previous_query}
**User Feedback**: {user_feedback}
**Previous Complexity**: {previous_complexity}
**Previous Execution Plan**: {previous_execution_plan}
**Available Schema**: {schema_summary}
**Conversation Context**: {conversation_context}

## Analysis Task

Re-analyze the request considering the failure feedback and determine improvements:

### 1. FEEDBACK ANALYSIS
Categorize the user feedback:
- **schema_issues**: Wrong tables, missing columns, incorrect references
- **complexity_issues**: Too complex, needs simplification, or needs more steps
- **logic_issues**: Wrong calculation, incorrect filtering, mismatched intent
- **syntax_issues**: KDB syntax problems, formatting issues
- **performance_issues**: Query too slow, needs optimization

### 2. ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFICATION
Identify what went wrong:
- Was the schema selection appropriate?
- Was the complexity level correct?
- Did the execution plan match user intent?
- Were there misunderstandings about requirements?

### 3. IMPROVEMENT STRATEGY
Determine the corrective approach:
- **escalate_complexity**: Move from SINGLE_LINE to MULTI_LINE or higher
- **simplify_approach**: Reduce complexity if user found it too complex
- **fix_schema_selection**: Use different/better tables from available schema
- **revise_execution_plan**: Change the logical approach while keeping complexity
- **clarify_intent**: Address misunderstanding of user requirements

### 4. SCHEMA-AWARE REANALYSIS
With feedback in mind, re-analyze:
- Should different tables be used?
- Does the complexity need to change?
- Should the execution plan be revised?
- Are there schema constraints that were missed?

## Output Format

```

## Examples

**Example 1 - Syntax Error:**
Validation: "Unbalanced parentheses in KDB expression"
→ PRIMARY_ISSUE_TYPE: syntax_error
→ RECOMMENDED_ACTION: fix_syntax_keep_complexity
→ COMPLEXITY_RECOMMENDATION: keep_current

**Example 2 - Schema Mismatch:**

→ SCHEMA_CORRECTIONS: Replace 'prices' with 'market_price'

**Example 3 - Complexity Issue:**
Validation: "Single-line query too complex, needs intermediate steps"
